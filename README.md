# The Project (TravelFriends❤️)

**TravelFriends❤️** is an individual portfolio project that I've made after 9 weeks of coding at Codaisseur.

Travelling is my passion and that’s why a lot of people always ask me for travel tips when they go to a country where I've been. At the moment I don’t have a place where I store my travel tips so every time a friend asks me for a tip I have to try to remember what I did and where I went in that specific country.

On the other hand, if I go to a new country and I would like to have some tips myself, I don’t always know who of my friends already went to this country and who could have some good tips to share.

I want to be able to share my best travel experiences with my friends and search for their tips and that’s why I’ve created this app.

# Description of the project

The project is a mobile app made using React Native.

# Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to practice everything I've learned in the past weeks at Codaisseur and also learn new technologies like React Native.

**What I've learned:**
How to use React Native to create a mobile app
Run and debug React Native apps
Work with the core components and APIs
Build reusable components
Apply beautiful styles to components
Get input from the user
Publish apps to Expo
Write clean code

# Starting the app

- The app is made with React-Native using Expo, so you need Expo to run the app of your phone or a simulator.
- The server at TravelFriends-BE should run in order to fetch the travel tips and the rest of the data displayed on the app.
