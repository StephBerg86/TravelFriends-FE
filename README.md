## The Project (TravelFriends‚ù§Ô∏è)

**TravelFriends‚ù§Ô∏è** is an individual portfolio project that I've made after 9 weeks of coding at Codaisseur.

Travelling is my passion and that‚Äôs why a lot of people always ask me for travel tips when they go to a country where I've been. At the moment I don‚Äôt have a place where I store my travel tips so every time a friend asks me for a tip I have to try to remember what I did and where I went in that specific country.

On the other hand, if I go to a new country and I would like to have some tips myself, I don‚Äôt always know who of my friends already went to this country and who could have some good tips to share.

I want to be able to share my best travel experiences with my friends and search for their tips and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve created this app.

## Description of the project üñå

The project is a mobile app made using React Native. You can search for travel tips and share your own tips with your friends.

## Goal of the project ü•Ö

The goal of this project is to practice everything that I've learned in the past weeks at Codaisseur and also to learn new technologies like React Native.

**What I've learned:** ü§ì
* How to use React Native to create a mobile app
* Run and debug React Native apps
* Work with the core components and APIs
* Build reusable components
* Apply styles to components
* Get input from the user
* Publish apps to Expo
* Write clean code

# Starting the app üì≤

- The app is made with React-Native using Expo, so you need Expo to run the app on your phone or a simulator.
- The server at TravelFriends-BE should run in order to fetch the travel tips and the rest of the data displayed on the app.
